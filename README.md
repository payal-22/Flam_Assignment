# Interactive Bézier Rope Simulation

## Introduction

Hi!  
In this assignment, I built an **interactive cubic Bézier curve** that behaves like a **soft, springy rope**.  
The curve reacts in real time to user input and visually explains how **Bézier curves, tangents, and basic physics** work together.

I intentionally implemented everything **from scratch**, without using any built-in Bézier, animation, or physics libraries, so that I could truly understand the underlying math and motion instead of relying on abstractions.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to:

- Implement a cubic Bézier curve using its mathematical definition  
- Add smooth, natural motion using a spring–damping physics model  
- Visualize tangent vectors along the curve  
- Handle real-time interaction and rendering at ~60 FPS  

In simple words:  
 *When I move the mouse, the curve should bend smoothly like a rope instead of snapping instantly.*
